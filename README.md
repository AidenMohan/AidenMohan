Hyia!

I'm school kid from Australia exploring the world of coding and technology. This GitHub profile serves as a digital playground for both my personal projects and some of the coding assignments I encounter at school.

You'll likely find a mix of things here â€“ from small personal experiments and hobby projects to code related to my coursework. 

Feel free to take a look around. Any feedback or suggestions on my personal projects are always welcome.

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º
